Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

    The goal was to create a functioning inventory app. There were a few user needs. 
    1) We needed to check the username and password against the database when the user attempts to log in. If the user has never logged into the application before, the        user should be able to create a new login and password. The application needs to save these to a table in the database. 
    2) Create: The user should be able to add items to a database.
       Delete: The user should be able to remove items from a database.
       Update: The user should be able to change the value associated with individual database items (e.g. the number of a specific item in an inventory or the date of          an event). 
       Read: The user should be able to view all of the database items displayed as a grid.
    3) If the user grants permissions, the application should send alerts to the user as SMS messages. The alerts correspond to the specific notification trigger of the        application you chose (low inventory, an upcoming event, or reaching a goal weight).
       If the user denies permission, then the rest of the application should still continue to function without the SMS messaging notification feature.
    4) Employ industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance readability of code.
       Have I kept my classes concise?
       Is my style consistent throughout the code?
       Would my naming conventions make sense to anyone else who looked at my code?
       Do my in-line comments contain enough useful information?

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    
     I had a login screen. There was a register screen for first time visitors. The main Home screen was the list of items in a grid. There is a pop up screen for adding an item as well as one for editing an item. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
